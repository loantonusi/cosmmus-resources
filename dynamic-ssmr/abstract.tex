%Borrow from SSMR paper

State machine replication (SMR) is a well-known technique for providing a fault-tolerant, high availability service, by having clients commands executed in the same other on all replicas, following the deterministic execution, producing same state of all replica for each client command. 
%
The original SMR model was not quite efficient since adding replica to the system doesn't increase the performance or throughput, since all replicas still have to execute same number of commands. 
%
Scalable SMR \mbox{(S-SMR)} then was introduced to address that problem by partitioning the application state, that allow client commands go through a combination of replicas, but not necessary all the replicas, while still maintain the consistency of the system.
%
However \mbox{(S-SMR)} ....
