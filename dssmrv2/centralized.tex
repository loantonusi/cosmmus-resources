\section{The centralized partitioning scheme}

\fp{Here we should describe the new scheme, which computes partitions on the fly based on feedback from the oracle}

\subsection{Dynamic repartitioning}
%How do we do a repartitioning?
Whenever an external agent to the system decides that there should be a new partitioning, it sends a \emph{Partition} command to the oracle, which executes the respective step in algorithm~\ref{alg:oracle_partition}. The system continues to operate normally while the partitioning is taking place.
